PHPDevShell V 3.2.0-Stable-DB-3140 (Revision-bzr 898)
-----------------------------------------------------
Information:
Major release focuses on Ajax capabilities and general structure enhancements. It also ensures better maintainability of views.

IMPORTANT:
There are a few small changes that might remove styling from your controllers if you use the default theme, please check the website to identify these changes.
The reason for this is the fact that instead of calling the whole jquery-ui js code base, we only call the core and plugins needs to be called explicitly, this speeds up things allot.
