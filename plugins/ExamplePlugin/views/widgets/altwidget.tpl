<h4>Ah, found the alternative, {$name}</h4>
<p><strong>When editing the menu for simple-widget.php, change this layout to "altwidget.tpl" and an alternative layout will load.</strong></p>
<p>I have received passed data from main controller: <em>{$data}</em>, more data: <em>{$moredata}</em>. Widgets are used to create mini applications inside a main web page.</p>
<p>Obviously all web elements is available. Widgets are created the exact same way as normal nodes.</p>
<p>
	<button type="submit" value="{_e('Some Button')}" name="subscribe"><span class="save"></span><span>{_e('Some Button')}</span></button>
</p>
