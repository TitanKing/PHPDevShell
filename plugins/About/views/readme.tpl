        <h2>Some Features...</h2>

        <h3>Themes</h3>

        <p>
            Using the most stable and best HTML5 and CSS3 features the theme is what wraps your application.
            Standard elements are used, in other words, there is no need to learn endless classes to make your
            application look consistent on every page. Just type HTML in your view as you know it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Itâ€™s extremely easy to create your own theme, and it is 100% customizable.
            PHPDevShell was built using minimal styling making it easier for you to build upon.
        </p>

        <h2>Bootstrap</h2>

        <p>
            PHPDevShell UI was built using Bootstrap. Bootstrap is a clean and powerful UI CSS framework
            for JQuery, it offers you an easy to override CCS framework for your project. If you like to fall in
            with Bootstrap and have a solid base right from the start you have even less work waiting for you.
        </p>
